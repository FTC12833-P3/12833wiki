<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>FTC Control</h1><br/><p>FTC control is a new dashboard that is trying to replace ftc Dashboard. Currently it has issues with most everything.</p><p>The hardest part is to actually download it to your project, then to add limelight is even more to do.</p><p>The biggest reason for using this currently is for limelight streaming. </p><p>FTC dashboard has also added this feature, but currently have no documentation on it.</p><p>Ftc Control is able to run opModes, draw your robot on a field map, and camera stream. </p><p></p><p>Currently I&#39;d say that it is not worth the effort, but is something to keep an eye on. I figure that it will be much less stable than dashboard at least for a couple years and has a much smaller user base. </p><p></p><p>Here is the website: <a href="https://ftcontrol.bylazar.com/docs/overview/">https://ftcontrol.bylazar.com/docs/overview/</a></p></div>
